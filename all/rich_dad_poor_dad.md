1. Poor and middle class people work for money; wealthy people have money work for them.
2. Life teaches you lessons by pushing you around. Most people give up, but some people learn from it and look forward to more lessons.
3. Most people are controlled by fear and greed, so they trade their lives for security or desire.
4. Making more money doesn't help most people because they will only acquire more debt.
