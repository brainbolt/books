## Chapter 1: The Rich Don't Work for Money

1. Poor and middle class people work for money; wealthy people have money work for them.
2. Life teaches you lessons by pushing you around. Most people give up, but some people learn from it and look forward to more lessons.
3. Most people are controlled by fear and greed, so they trade their lives for security or desire.
4. Making more money doesn't help most people because they will only acquire more debt.
5. Most people allow their emotions to control them without realizing it. Learn to see your emotions **and** to see and think clearly.

## Chapter 2: Why Teach Financial Literacy?

1. It's not how much you make but how much you keep.
2. If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate
3. Understand the difference between an asset and a liability: an asset puts money in your pocket and a liability takes money out of your pocket.
4. Becoming rich is very simple: buy assets.
5. A home is a liability, even though most people consider it an asset.
6. Robert's definition of "wealth" is inspired by  R. Buckminster Fuller: "Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many days forward--or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?"
