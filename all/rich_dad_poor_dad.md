## Chapter 1: The Rich Don't Work for Money

1. Poor and middle class people work for money; wealthy people have money work for them.
2. Life teaches you lessons by pushing you around. Most people give up, but some people learn from it and look forward to more lessons.
3. Most people are controlled by fear and greed, so they trade their lives for security or desire.
4. Making more money doesn't help most people because they will only acquire more debt.
5. Most people allow their emotions to control them without realizing it. Learn to see your emotions **and** to see and think clearly.

## Chapter 2: Why Teach Financial Literacy?

1. It's not how much you make but how much you keep.
2. If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate
3. Understand the difference between an asset and a liability: an asset puts money in your pocket and a liability takes money out of your pocket.
4. Becoming rich is very simple: buy assets.
5. A home is a liability, even though most people consider it an asset.
6. Robert's definition of "wealth" is inspired by  R. Buckminster Fuller: "Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many days forward--or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?"

## Chapter 3: Mind Your Own Business

1. McDonald's founder Ray Kroc considered himself to be in the Real Estate business, not the food business. McDonald's owns a massive amount of valuable Real Estate.
2. Avoid working your entire life for someone else
3. Many people confuse their profession for their business.
4. Your business revolves around your assets
5. The primary reason the poor and middle class are afraid to take financial risk is because they have no financial foundation and therefore must play it safe
6. Assets fall into the following categories:
    - Businesses that do not require your presence to operate
    - Stocks
    - Bonds
    - Income-generating Real Estate
    - Notes (IOU's)
    - Intellectual Property that generates roylaties
    - Anything else that has value, produces income, appreciates, and has a ready market
7. Acquire assets that you love - if you aren't genuinely interested in something, don't invest in it
8. Keep your day job, but build your assets while you work
9. Luxuries should be acquired only with income generated by assets

## Chapter 4: The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations

1. Robert's rich dad considered Robin Hood a crook, even though many people see him as a hero.
2. The middle class are the most heavily taxed group.
3. Government is incentivized to hire more people and spend lots of money. Business is incentivized to hire as few people as possible and spend as little money as possible.
4. Government is incentivized to avoid having excess money. Business is incentivized to have lots of excess money.
5. A corporation is simply a legal document which creates a legal entity.
6. Financial intelligence is made up of 4 things:
    1. Accounting (financial literacy, or the ability to read numbers and evaluate a business' strengths and weaknesses)
    2. Investing (making money from money)
    3. Understanding markets (supply and demand, market conditions)
    4. The Law (tax advantages and protections)
7. Corporations pay expenses __before__ taxes. Individuals pay expenses __after__ taxes.
8. Corporations can be used as a means of legal protection.
9. Wealthy people own very little, but control a lot through corporate structuring.
