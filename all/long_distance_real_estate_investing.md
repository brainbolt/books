## Chapter 1: Why Invest Out of State?
- "Ninety percent of millionaires become so through real estate. More money has been made in real estate than in all industrial investments combined. The wise young man or wage earner of today invests his money in real estate." - Andrew Carnegie 
- Andrew Carnegie was one of the first American rags-to-riches stories. He worked many different jobs and invested in many industries, making his ultimate fortune by selling Carnegie Steel Company for $480 milliion in 1901, making him one of the weatlthiest people in the world at that time. He gave away tremendous amounts of money over the rest of his life. He was a dominate business person with an incredible amount of experience and knowledge. With all of his knowledge, he recommended people invest their money in real estate.
- "In any profession, the longer you seek to understand the process, not the just the results, the better you will be at understanding the patterns that emerge."
- We often expect ourselves to be perfect as soon as we start getting into real estate, but we should give ourselves enough time to develop or skills.
- Often people are trained to look for reasons _not to_ do something, especially out-of-state investing.
- Invest where it makes the most sense for you, not where it is convenient, close, or comfortable.
### Don't Trust Your Gut
- Most people believe that you have to see a house to buy it, but they're really letting their feelings control them. They _feel_ more comfortable when they can see it for themselves.
- Investors focus on numbers; consumers focus on feelings.
- Feelings are not a good measure of a business investment.
- Emotions should be tuned out and you should use facts to make decisions.
- You have to be willing to do things in a different way than the "norm".
### Disrupt the Norm
- In the past, the only way to invest out of state was to trust people in the area. Trust leads to opportunity for fraud, and there was lots of fraud. The internet has changed all of this, but not everyone has realized it.
- Zillow (and companies like them) have changed the market through access to information. Technology changes things and it can be used as an effective weapon against the competition. 
- Technology is an important part of this process.
### Investing in Your Own Backyard
- "Investing in your own backyard" is the same as "investing where you know."
- You must understand the market in which you are investing, it just doesn't have to be near you.
### The Crop Analogy
- Think of different real estate markets as different fields for growing crops. Some will be better suited for different plants, and some farmers are more experienced in certain types of crops, but while the wise farmers understands that different crops require different knowledge, he also knows that they follow similar patterns, and that they could learn how to grow them.
- Real estate investing is a get-rich-slow game. The real value comes years after purchase, when rents have risen, the value of the property has increased, and significant equity has been accrued.
- Invest where demand is growing, not just in what is geographically close.
- Understanding different areas, emerging markets, and price-to-rent ratios is critical to investing well.
- Wealth can be built faster through combining strategies such as flipping, buy-and-hold rentals, and anticipating/reacting to market changes.
- Be an investor who dilligently studies what to grow, where to grow it, and how to hire the field hands to do so.
#### (end of The Crop Analogy)
- When you you invest in real estate, you build wealth in your sleep, or while you're building other wealth, or working out at the gym. 
- "Landlords grow rich in their sleep without working, risking, or economizing" - John Stuart Mill
