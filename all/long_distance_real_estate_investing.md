## Chapter 1: Why Invest Out of State?
- "Ninety percent of millionaires become so through real estate. More money has been made in real estate than in all industrial investments combined. The wise young man or wage earner of today invests his money in real estate." - Andrew Carnegie 
- Andrew Carnegie was one of the first American rags-to-riches stories. He worked many different jobs and invested in many industries, making his ultimate fortune by selling Carnegie Steel Company for $480 million in 1901, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world at that time. He gave away tremendous amounts of money over the rest of his life. He was a dominate business person with an incredible amount of experience and knowledge. With all of his knowledge, he recommended people invest their money in real estate.
- "In any profession, the longer you seek to understand the process, not the just the results, the better you will be at understanding the patterns that emerge."
- We often expect ourselves to be perfect as soon as we start getting into real estate, but we should give ourselves enough time to develop or skills.
- Often people are trained to look for reasons _not to_ do something, especially out-of-state investing.
- Invest where it makes the most sense for you, not where it is convenient, close, or comfortable.
### Don't Trust Your Gut
- Most people believe that you have to see a house to buy it, but they're really letting their feelings control them. They _feel_ more comfortable when they can see it for themselves.
- Investors focus on numbers; consumers focus on feelings.
- Feelings are not a good measure of a business investment.
- Emotions should be tuned out and you should use facts to make decisions.
- You have to be willing to do things in a different way than the "norm".
### Disrupt the Norm
- In the past, the only way to invest out of state was to trust people in the area. Trust leads to opportunity for fraud, and there was lots of fraud. The internet has changed all of this, but not everyone has realized it.
- Zillow (and companies like them) have changed the market through access to information. Technology changes things and it can be used as an effective weapon against the competition. 
- Technology is an important part of this process.
### Investing in Your Own Backyard
- "Investing in your own backyard" is the same as "investing where you know."
- You must understand the market in which you are investing, it just doesn't have to be near you.
### The Crop Analogy
- Think of different real estate markets as different fields for growing crops. Some will be better suited for different plants, and some farmers are more experienced in certain types of crops, but while the wise farmers understands that different crops require different knowledge, he also knows that they follow similar patterns, and that they could learn how to grow them.
- Real estate investing is a get-rich-slow game. The real value comes years after purchase, when rents have risen, the value of the property has increased, and significant equity has been accrued.
- Invest where demand is growing, not just in what is geographically close.
- Understanding different areas, emerging markets, and price-to-rent ratios is critical to investing well.
- Wealth can be built faster through combining strategies such as flipping, buy-and-hold rentals, and anticipating/reacting to market changes.
- Be an investor who diligently studies what to grow, where to grow it, and how to hire the field hands to do so.
#### (end of The Crop Analogy)
- When you you invest in real estate, you build wealth in your sleep, or while you're building other wealth, or working out at the gym. 
- "Landlords grow rich in their sleep without working, risking, or economizing" - John Stuart Mill

## Chapter 2: The Power of The Internet
- The internet is a powerful tool for long-distance real estate investing.
- MLS systems are the largest and most convenient method for buying properties.
- Property taxes are one of the largest, but easiest to overlook expenses in investment real estate. 
    - Tax records are often available online via county's tax assessor's website, and are often readily available via apps like Zillow.
    - Look out for "hidden" tax expenses like bonds which must be paid for by homeowners.
- Homeowner's insurance is important to understand:
    - Quotes can be easily acquired either by requesting them directly from agents or by getting online quotes.
    - Consider keeping your costs down by getting the largest deductible possible.
    - Looks for insurance agency reviews for specific areas via google w/ searches like "best homeowner's insurance Atlanta", or "investor homeowner's insurance Atlanta". Look for review's of insurers on blogs.
- Determine an area's desirability:
    - The best information comes from people intimately familiar with the area, but apps like Zillow and Trulia can offer metrics to help you confirm what you are being told.
    - Pay attention to:
        - School rankings
        - Walk score (how easy it is to live in an area without a car)
            - Most important in densely-populated areas
            - [WalkScore.com](http://walkscore.com)
        - Crime stats
            - High crime creates lots of problems in real estate investing.
            - Use Trulia's crime Heat Maps
- Determining rental rates:
    - Property managers will typically be the most accurate souce of information, but they are often optimistic 
    - In general, trust experts and verify what they are telling you
    - [Rentometer.com](http://rentometer.com) is a useful tool for _quickly_ determining rental pricing
    - craigslist is also very useful for getting _detailed_ information
        - How long do rental listings remain active?
        - How long have the properties have been vacant? (ask the owners)
        - How much activity are the rentals getting? (ask the owners)
        - If you see listings disappearing quickly, it is a good sign that there is a lot of demand.
    - The best information comes from people
- Finding past permits:
    - The reality of investment real estate is that the houses are usually older homes which often need some work, but this enables us to buy below market value.
    - Understanding the history of the work done on the house is important.
    - Many counties keep permits as public record available via their website.
    - Don't trust your own non-expert opinion over getting the facts.
### The internet cheat sheet:
- **General pricing and availability**: zillow, trulia
- **Property taxes**: county websites and some online services
- **Homeowners insurance**: online quotes and agent emails
- **Neighborhood fact checking**: walkability (walkscore), crime rates (trulia), school district scores (zillow, trulia)
- **Rental pricing**: rentometer, zillow
#### (end)

- Smartphones can be used to move very quickly, and quickness is required in this highly-competitive field.
### Using technology to buy property sight unseen
- "Information makes people think; emotion makes them act."
- Photos and smartphone videos are a more-than-sufficient substitute for seeing a house in person.
- The big picture:
    - Video serves as proof of work done by a contractor (if they won't send photos, something fishy is going on) and as documentation of each step of the rehab process, which can be used as a sales tool.
    - Ask the person selling you the property to send you the following video:
        1. Start on the side walk in front of the property and walk the exterior.
        2. Walk the entire interior, audibly pointing out the features of the home you should take notice of, the areas you may miss, and the problem areas you will want to note for later.
        - This provides a ton of useful information that can be passed on to property managers, contractors, or anyone else.
### Battling the bugs
- If you encounter issues transferring phone videos, upload to youtube.
### Using your smartphone
- Many people aren't as busy as they think they are.
- Manage your time by breaking your communication into small, manageable chunks instead of trying to hash it all out at once.
- Many phone calls include a lot of time spent on etiquette and pleasantries which aren't really necessary. Text messages can be a useful alternative.
### Smartphone Apps
- Apps are good.
- Mortgage Calculator Plus
- JotNot Pro: convert paper files into pdfs by taking pictures
- DocuSign
- Skype: Some notaries will operate over video calls
- Numbers: spreadsheet
- Rev: voice note recordings 
- Keller Williams: home pricing
### The cloud
- It's good.
