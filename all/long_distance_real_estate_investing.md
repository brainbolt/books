## Chapter 1: Why Invest Out of State?
_"Ninety percent of millionaires become so through real estate. More money has been made in real estate than in all industrial investments combined. The wise young man or wage earner of today invests his money in real estate."_ - Andrew Carnegie 
- Andrew Carnegie was one of the first American rags-to-riches stories. He worked many different jobs and invested in many industries, making his ultimate fortune by selling Carnegie Steel Company for $480 million in 1901, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world at that time. He gave away tremendous amounts of money over the rest of his life. He was a dominate business person with an incredible amount of experience and knowledge. With all of his knowledge, he recommended people invest their money in real estate.
- "In any profession, the longer you seek to understand the process, not the just the results, the better you will be at understanding the patterns that emerge."
- We often expect ourselves to be perfect as soon as we start getting into real estate, but we should give ourselves enough time to develop or skills.
- Often people are trained to look for reasons _not to_ do something, especially out-of-state investing.
- Invest where it makes the most sense for you, not where it is convenient, close, or comfortable.
### Don't Trust Your Gut
- Most people believe that you have to see a house to buy it, but they're really letting their feelings control them. They _feel_ more comfortable when they can see it for themselves.
- Investors focus on numbers; consumers focus on feelings.
- Feelings are not a good measure of a business investment.
- Emotions should be tuned out and you should use facts to make decisions.
- You have to be willing to do things in a different way than the "norm".
### Disrupt the Norm
- In the past, the only way to invest out of state was to trust people in the area. Trust leads to opportunity for fraud, and there was lots of fraud. The internet has changed all of this, but not everyone has realized it.
- Zillow (and companies like them) have changed the market through access to information. Technology changes things and it can be used as an effective weapon against the competition. 
- Technology is an important part of this process.
### Investing in Your Own Backyard
- "Investing in your own backyard" is the same as "investing where you know."
- You must understand the market in which you are investing, it just doesn't have to be near you.
### The Crop Analogy
- Think of different real estate markets as different fields for growing crops. Some will be better suited for different plants, and some farmers are more experienced in certain types of crops, but while the wise farmers understands that different crops require different knowledge, he also knows that they follow similar patterns, and that they could learn how to grow them.
- Real estate investing is a get-rich-slow game. The real value comes years after purchase, when rents have risen, the value of the property has increased, and significant equity has been accrued.
- Invest where demand is growing, not just in what is geographically close.
- Understanding different areas, emerging markets, and price-to-rent ratios is critical to investing well.
- Wealth can be built faster through combining strategies such as flipping, buy-and-hold rentals, and anticipating/reacting to market changes.
- Be an investor who diligently studies what to grow, where to grow it, and how to hire the field hands to do so.
#### (end of The Crop Analogy)
- When you you invest in real estate, you build wealth in your sleep, or while you're building other wealth, or working out at the gym. 
_"Landlords grow rich in their sleep without working, risking, or economizing"_ - John Stuart Mill

## Chapter 2: The Power of The Internet
- The internet is a powerful tool for long-distance real estate investing.
- MLS systems are the largest and most convenient method for buying properties.
- Property taxes are one of the largest, but easiest to overlook expenses in investment real estate. 
    - Tax records are often available online via county's tax assessor's website, and are often readily available via apps like Zillow.
    - Look out for "hidden" tax expenses like bonds which must be paid for by homeowners.
- Homeowner's insurance is important to understand:
    - Quotes can be easily acquired either by requesting them directly from agents or by getting online quotes.
    - Consider keeping your costs down by getting the largest deductible possible.
    - Looks for insurance agency reviews for specific areas via google w/ searches like "best homeowner's insurance Atlanta", or "investor homeowner's insurance Atlanta". Look for review's of insurers on blogs.
- Determine an area's desirability:
    - The best information comes from people intimately familiar with the area, but apps like Zillow and Trulia can offer metrics to help you confirm what you are being told.
    - Pay attention to:
        - School rankings
        - Walk score (how easy it is to live in an area without a car)
            - Most important in densely-populated areas
            - [WalkScore.com](http://walkscore.com)
        - Crime stats
            - High crime creates lots of problems in real estate investing.
            - Use Trulia's crime Heat Maps
- Determining rental rates:
    - Property managers will typically be the most accurate souce of information, but they are often optimistic 
    - In general, trust experts and verify what they are telling you
    - [Rentometer.com](http://rentometer.com) is a useful tool for _quickly_ determining rental pricing
    - craigslist is also very useful for getting _detailed_ information
        - How long do rental listings remain active?
        - How long have the properties have been vacant? (ask the owners)
        - How much activity are the rentals getting? (ask the owners)
        - If you see listings disappearing quickly, it is a good sign that there is a lot of demand.
    - The best information comes from people
- Finding past permits:
    - The reality of investment real estate is that the houses are usually older homes which often need some work, but this enables us to buy below market value.
    - Understanding the history of the work done on the house is important.
    - Many counties keep permits as public record available via their website.
    - Don't trust your own non-expert opinion over getting the facts.
### The internet cheat sheet:
- **General pricing and availability**: zillow, trulia
- **Property taxes**: county websites and some online services
- **Homeowners insurance**: online quotes and agent emails
- **Neighborhood fact checking**: walkability (walkscore), crime rates (trulia), school district scores (zillow, trulia)
- **Rental pricing**: rentometer, zillow
#### (end)

- Smartphones can be used to move very quickly, and quickness is required in this highly-competitive field.
### Using technology to buy property sight unseen
- "Information makes people think; emotion makes them act."
- Photos and smartphone videos are a more-than-sufficient substitute for seeing a house in person.
- The big picture:
    - Video serves as proof of work done by a contractor (if they won't send photos, something fishy is going on) and as documentation of each step of the rehab process, which can be used as a sales tool.
    - Ask the person selling you the property to send you the following video:
        1. Start on the side walk in front of the property and walk the exterior.
        2. Walk the entire interior, audibly pointing out the features of the home you should take notice of, the areas you may miss, and the problem areas you will want to note for later.
        - This provides a ton of useful information that can be passed on to property managers, contractors, or anyone else.
### Battling the bugs
- If you encounter issues transferring phone videos, upload to youtube.
### Using your smartphone
- Many people aren't as busy as they think they are.
- Manage your time by breaking your communication into small, manageable chunks instead of trying to hash it all out at once.
- Many phone calls include a lot of time spent on etiquette and pleasantries which aren't really necessary. Text messages can be a useful alternative.
### Smartphone Apps
- Apps are good.
- Mortgage Calculator Plus
- JotNot Pro: convert paper files into pdfs by taking pictures
- DocuSign
- Skype: Some notaries will operate over video calls
- Numbers: spreadsheet
- Rev: voice note recordings 
- Keller Williams: home pricing
### The cloud
- It's good.

## Chapter 3: Rules and relationships
_"If you don't have a competitive advantage, don't compete"_ - Jack Welch
- Real estate investing is about finding deals, plain and simple.
- You make your money when you buy.
- The entire investing process should be viewed as trying to lose as little equity as possible.
- The most efficient investors are those who have learned to:
    1. Find properties below market value.
    2. Prepare them to be rented or sold by adding the most value for the least money.
- Your main goal should be to find value efficiently.
- Paying full price in a great area won't build wealth as fast as getting a great deal in a good area.
- Even if you know how to find great deals, it won't help if you don't know how to assemble a good team to help you.
- Focus on your areas of strength and lean on experts in your areas of weakness.
- You will want to quit if you make things too hard for yourself. Most people overestimate their willpower.

### Price-to-rent ratios
_"Buy not on optimism but on arithmetic"_ - Warren Buffet
- The buy-and-hold strategy requires a market where rents haven't been outpaced by home values. If they have, money can still be made by flipping houses.
    - **Buy-and-hold**: The house will rent for more than the expenses associated with the property.
    - **Flipping**: The house will sell for significantly more than the cost of purchase plus rehab.
- Many successful investors have portfolios in the South or Midwest, where PTR ratios are historically strong.
- Not many people have large portfolios in NY or CA because of the high prices

### Determine an areas PTR ratio
- Basically, subtract the costs from the recurring rental income. If you have money left over, you're making money. Otherwise, no.
- Rules of thumb (quick, fast, and dirty calculations)
    - When he sees a potential opportunity, David first runs the 1% calc to see if it meets his criteria for rentals. If not, he runs the 70% rule. If neither work, he passes.
    - Teach your agent to run these numbers for you before bringing you a property to consider.
    - **1% rule** (useful for rental investing): if a property can rent for 1% of its sale price each month, there is a good chance it will cash-flow well.
    - **70% rule** (useful for flipping): multiply the after-repair value (ARV) by 70% and then subtract your expected rehab expenses to come up with a conservative purchasing offer that will likely cover holding costs, quiet costs, unexpected expenses, permits, missions, and taxes.
    - **2% rule**: typically this metric means that the property is either a screaming deal, or that the neighborhood is a problem. Approach with extreme caution and only with the help of people with experience in this type of market.
    - **50% rule**: 50% of the rental income will go towards repairs and holding costs other than the mortgage. David considers this too general.

### Alternatives to buy-and-hold
- **Flipping**: faster with more profit compared to the slower profit realization of buy-and-hold.
    - Typically the main difference is in the types of materials used in the rehab (flipping usually involves more expensive, higher-quality materials)
- **Slow-flip**: buy the house, live in it for a year or two (while rehabilitating, if necessary), and then sell it. There can be tax advantages to this approach.

### Vacation rentals
- Potentially more income, but also potentially more work to rent and prepare, and more liability.

### How to leverage relationships
- There can be huge advantages in having contacts in or intimate knowledge of an area.
- Relationships drive success.
- Being taught by someone is 100 times easier than learning on your own.
- The most important person on your team is the one finding you deals.
- As David has grown as an investor, he has stopped looking for deals and has started looking for people who have them.
- When he started investing in Florida, David had a competitive advantage because he had a wholesaler who would bring him deals and a lender who would provider him with better financing than he could get anywhere else. Then he found the other missing pieces. He now believes this is the way to go - leverage relationships to build a foundation first. These relationships take time and effort and not all of them are home runs, but we all know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody else who might be helpful for us in reaching our goals.

_"The richest people in the world look for and build networks everyone else looks for work. Marinate on that for a minute"_ - Robert Kiyosaki

## Chapter 4: The first members of your team
_"Everyone enjoys the kind of work for which he is best suited"_ - Napoleon Hill
- Leveraging the talents of skilled professionals is very important in this business, and one of your goals is to identify the right people and to help them succeed.
- Automating by outsourcing frees up more of your time to do what really matters to you
- Real estate investing is a business and needs to be run like one. Use trial and error, consistency, and wisdom to find the people who are really, really good at what they do so you can save time, money, and anxiety.
### Key people to look for
### The deal finder
- **The most important part of your business.**
- Traditionally a real estate agent (REA), but sometimes wholesalers.
- Good REA's are worth their weight in gold because they are surrounded by people who are likely to find the properties investors want and they are trained in finding properties and handling the transactions.
- Use a REA over a wholesaler in the beginning, especially when buying out of state unless you are an experienced investor with a good accountant, good counsel, and a knack for paperwork.
- The seller pays the agent, not the buyer. Even if you can theoretically get a better deal by not using an agent, this usually doesn't work out in practice because people willing to sell under market value are usually motivated by circumstances rather than purely by money - they are often trying to solve a problem.
- The drawbacks of using an agent are small, and the benefits are large.

#### High-producing agents
- Online reviews can be a great way to find an agent.
- While number of sales is not the most important factor, it can be a good indicator that the agent works well with others and that they are less likely to waste your time and are more likely to have additional resources you will need later.
- <http://zillow.com/agent-finder> can be a great way to find high-producing agents.

#### Agents with a team
- Often run a team because they have had so much success that they needed help.
- Can often cherry-pick the best/brightest agents to work for them.
- They are often personally too busy to working with a needy investor, so they will usually refer you to their "buyer's agent" to be your point of contact. This person is very likely to be a good agent since they work for the high-producer and have access to the high-producer's resources.

#### Ways to save time on your search
- Use email to introduce yourself to REA's instead of trying to call all of them - you are more likely to get through to them and you can include more information that will help the agent know if they are a good fit for your needs.
    - Things to include in an email introduction:
        1. That you are an investor
        2. What specifically you are looking for
        3. How you intend to purchase (cash, loan, etc.)
        4. How you heard about them
        - Make it specific enough that they can see that you are serious and that your aren't going to waste their time.
- Ask the right questions to find the right agent
    - **Do they have experience working with investors?** This is not required, but it is very helpful.
    - **Are they an investor themselves?** It is extremely helpful if the agent has been through the ups and downs of investing themselves.
        - If so, ask them what kind of returns they are experiencing, how they found the properties, what kind of analysis they used, and what drew them to investing in the first place. If they seem to be nonchalant about it, this may indicate that they are not systematically planning for growing a portfolio. If they are specific and meticulous and moved quickly when the right deal was found, they may be much better suited to help you find what you are looking for.
    - **What kind of support can they provide?** You want to know who your agent knows. Getting referrals is much more valuable than searching cold.
    - **How do they plan to find your potential properties?** If they don't have a clear plan, you may be in trouble.
    - Be sure to make it clear what kinds of properties you are wanting to see so you're not wasting your time looking through a bunch of results that will never work. The more specific, the better.

#### An agent and an investor - my advice to you

_"The most important single, central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit."_ - Milton Friedman

- Make sure it is worth your agent's time to keep working for you. They are likely to take their deals elsewhere if you waste their time.
- The people who most often "win" are the ones who are skilled in creating win-win scenarios that meet everyone's goals, not just their own.
- It is always tempting to be selfish, but it is rarely fruitful to do so.
- The most successful people in business have the most contacts for two reasons:
    1. They are well liked and draw successful people to them.
    2. They have been consistent with this for a long time.
- Agent's time is often wasted by potential clients.
- Those who do best in business are the ones who bring the most value to others.

### The lender
- A vital member of your team.
- One of the first piece you will want to get in place - a good lender can be difficult to find. If you can't find the financing, there isn't much point in putting in the time to find anything else.
- Lending is very standardized and it takes less time to determine if someone can help you, compared to an agent.

#### Lending standards
- There are a few universal standard metrics:
    1. **DTI**: 
        - Debt-to-income ratio: The amount you a obligated to spend each month to cover debts vs how much monthly income you have.
        - Lower is better.
        - Most banks prefer a DTI lower than 3-6%
    2. **LTV**: 
        - Loan-to-value. Used to determine the likelihood that the lender can recover their the amount loaned if you default.
        - The lower the LTV, the safer the investment is for the bank.
        - Calculated by comparing the amount of the loan to the value of the asset (the value often comes in the form of an appraisal)
        - Low LTV is typically worse for the investor because it means that less cash is available on hand.
        - When you put money down on a property, you are giving that money to the bank, you are giving that money to the seller so the bank doesn't have to.
    3. **Credit scores**:
        - Are important for determining your credit-worthiness, but usually aren't as important as most people think
        - The median of the three scores is usually used.

#### Loans for investors
- Most banks sell the loans that they make or pack them together into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs).
- FNMA (Fannie Mae) and FHLMC (Freddy Mac) are Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) responsible for insuring loans and helping to repackage them as MBSs. They set lending standards for loans before they will insure them. 
- Most banks will only offer loans that conform to Freddy and Fannie standards.
- Terms becomes more strict once you have four loans. 
- One you have 10 loans, you no longer qualify for Freddy/Fannie insured loans. It becomes much more difficult to find a loan once you have reached 10.
- The limitation doesn't consider the size of the loans or your creditworthiness, it is just an arbitrary limit on the quantity. So if you have 10 loans for $50k each, its worse than having one loan for $500k.
- "Portfolio lender" is a term sometimes used to describe a loan that a bank will keep on its own books. They become very important once you have 10 other loans. Once you have 10 loans, any additional cannot be sold as MBSs with the Fannie seal of approval, so your loan becomes less valuable to the bank.
- Portfolio loans are commonly adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) with starting rates about one point higher than Fannie/Freddy loans.
- The bottom line is that once you have 10 loans, terms for additional loans are going to be worse, and it will take more work to find them.

#### How to find a lender
- There are other lending source besides just banks:
    - **Mortgage brokers**: these loans often include extra costs to cover the broker's commission, which often results in paying higher rates or more points up front. They often aren't the best option, but they can be a great option if your need someone to go to work on your behalf.
    - **Credit unions**: they are more likely to keep the loan on their own books. They are often very flexible because they are smaller, community oriented, and individually managed.

#### How to reach out to lenders
- Lenders usually want people applying for loans to fill out an applications. This is very time consuming when doing many of them.
- Save your self time by emailing lenders a summary of the information you already know they will want as a way to get them to quickly evaluate you before asking you to fill out an application. Include:
    - That you live out of state.
    - Your middle credit score.
    - DTI
    - How much reserves you have to cover your properties.
    - That you claim your income on your tax return.
- When looking for loan 11 and up, most of the time you are going to be told no. This is great because it saves you from wasting any more of your or their time. Always follow up asking if they know who your should talk to.

#### Alternative lending options
- If you have special circumstances, you may be able to find solutions by looking for advertising in investing and real estate forums.

#### The ease of electronic payments
- They're great.

#### Supercharging your equity growth
- Make extra payments to minimize the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan. 

#### Electronic rent deposits
- Use services like venmo and paypal to make and receive payments.

#### Leveraging financing
- Leveraging: borrowing money at a lower rate than you can make investing in another.
- Real estate is one of the best ways to do this because they costs of loans are so low.
- **Debt-to-income ratio**: 
    - Make sure that for every expense you take on, you have much, much more extra income to make up for it. 
    - Think of it like body fat percentage - you want to make sure that you always are burning more calories (income) than you are taking in (expenses).
- **Portfolio LTV**:
    - Closely watch the LTV of your entire portfolio.
    - A 70% LTV is a good goal for your portfolio.

#### Accurately reporting rental income
- Three schools of thought:
    1. Avoid paying taxes as much as possible (legally)
    2. Run as profitably as possible, even if it means paying more taxes
    3. Break the law
- Out of options 1 and 2, the answers depends on where you are in your career and how badly you need the cash.
    - If your primary goal is to live off of present cash flow, it makes sense to avoid showing profits and minimize your tax burden. Just keep in mind that scrimping on every penny by minimizing how profitable your business appears could hurt your ability to get future financing.
    - If you are building your portfolio for future cash flow, then it is better to show your properties as more profitable. The future benefits of exponential growth will dwarf the benefits of cash in your pocket now.
- If you are making good income aside from your rental portfolio, you should take every possible allowance to decrease your taxable income. Just keep in mind that if commercial standards are being used (as is sometimes the case with blanket mortgages and commercial properties), your personal income is unlikely to be considered.

## Chapter 5: The rest of your team

_"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of gaints."_ - Isaac Newton

- The property manager is the next crucial member of the team.
- Property managers handle finding tenants, qualifying them, collecting rent, dealing with maintenance issues, etc.
- Vacancy and maintenance are some of the biggest expenses in rental real estate, and having a good property manager can reduce both significantly.
- Property management is not a luxury - it is crucial to running rental properties from out of state.
- Property management is a difficult job.
- An average fee of 7% is typical, and usually you can't take care of everything they do for that amount. They benefit greatly from the economy of scale that they get to realize.
- Good ones are hard to find, so when you find a good one, hold on to them.

### Finding referrals
- Referrals to good managers are _very_ valuable.
- Online resources like <http://biggerpockets.com> for communicating with other investors. The longer they have worked with them, the better.
- Initially, they are almost always likely to be very responsive in order to win your business. The more business you bring them, the more likely you are to remain a priority, and the better pricing you are able to negotiate, so don't spread your business among too many competitors in one area.

#### REAs
- Can be an awesome resource for managers.

#### Other investors
- Online forums, REIA meetings
- Investors love to talk about their business

### What to ask before hiring a property manager
- Their reputation is the most important factor.
- Maintenance is the most crucial factor determining the profitability of rentals is maintenance.
- The percentage fee charges by the manager is not the more important factor.
- The basics:
    - How much experience they have
    - How many doors they manage
    - What their strengths are
    - What systems do they have in place to make things efficient
- More specific questions:
    - Monthly percentage off of rent
    - Other fees to owners
    - Inspection frequency
    - How are maintenance/repair calls handled
    - How are evictions handled
    - Average turnaround for vacancies
- An experienced manager should be able to handle these questions quickly and easily.
- The best managers can handle most of these issues without taking too much of your time. The very best can do this in a cost-efficient and timely manner. The elite can this with minimal input from you.
- Use example scenarios to find out how a potential manager will handle maintenance issues: If you ask them how they would handle a call from a tenant about hot water not working in the shower, you want to see some sort of initiative on their part to minimize your costs, so it would be great if they tried to walk the tenant through checking/relighting the pilot light. The next best answer would be to have a relatively inexpensive handy man check it out. If they instantly suggest calling a licensed professional, that may be a bad sign. 
- Very inexpensive managers may be hurting for business or may be looking to make up their fees other ways. If they offer to do some services for free, they may not hold themselves accountable to them when the schedule gets tight.
- They should have a clear, comprehensive marketing plan prepared.
- Another thing to ask is what they think of properties in less than desirable areas. If you tell them that you are considering purchasing a property in a well-known "war zone", it is a very good sign if they decline to provide services, or even better, advise you not to buy there - this may show that you are willing to look out for your best interests.

### How to negotiate better terms
- Percentage of rent is usually a "vanity" number - look for the bigger picture and understand all the ways the manager will make money, and then try to trim the fat.
- Ask yourself what you can do to help them - put yourself in their shoes and think about what you can offer.

_"A barber lathers a man before he shaves him."_ - Dale Carnegie

### Leveraging your property managers knowledge
- Appeal to their pride by asking if you can have them "approve" properties you are considering. Having local input is very valuable, especially from someone knowledgable about the business.
- They know a lot about what potential tenants are looking for in neighborhoods, house types and sizes, schools, etc, and they also know what to avoid.
- Don't do this without property managers advising you on all things related to the market.

_"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed."_ - Proverbs 15:22

### The Contractor
- Usually the last person to add to your team.
- Can be very difficult to find, and other investors are likely to keep them to themselves.
- Always get itemized bids, otherwise it is difficult to know what you are paying for.
- You will probably go through several of them.
- Less regulation and supervision means it is more difficult to hold them accountable.
- There are lots of bad contractors.

#### Where to find contractors
- You need to rely on word of mouth, whether from online reviews, other investors, or trusted team members. 
- Finding one through another investor is the best way, but it is difficult, and you may have to have something to offer them. Develop relationships.
- Some are better suited for keeping costs low, and some are better suited for flips because they know the best materials and do beautiful work. Be sure to be clear about what you are looking for when asking for referrals.

#### The bidding process
- Your goal should be to find the person who impresses you the most, gives you the best prices, communicates the best, and shows you that they want to earn your business.
- They communicate very differently depending on how badly they want the job.
- They often are accustomed to working with very little input and may be annoyed if you try to do things different than "their" way.
- They will either understand your concerns and will be willing to work with you or they will blow you off.
- Ideas of fair prices, strictness of schedule, and what liberties they are allowed to take vary wildly between contractors.
- Some treat what they tell you as something that they will stand behind and some believe it is more of a guideline.
- During the bidding process you will get some clues about what to expect from the contractor, but you are unlikely to get the full picture of what kind of experience you are going to have.
- Keep an eye out for the ones offering input on ways to save you money and solve your problems. A contractor who sees a potential problem and reacts with several solution options is giving you a good sign.
- If they are willing to tell you when they think you are making a mistake, that's also a very good sign. 
- Communicate with them that you would love to hear their opinions and if they respond with a list of way to blow up the budget without good explanations for why, you probably want to say goodbye right away.
- Make it clear in the initial conversations what level of communication you are expecting, how you expect to pay them, and what kind of proof of work you are expecting during the process (pictures, videos, etc). If they are resistant at this stage, part ways with them with spending any more time on them. Not every one will be willing to work this way.
- If you have an active project, ask them to visit the property and produce a proposal for the work they think should be done. Asking them for their suggestions here can tell you a lot:
    1. The suggestions they make should be inline with the goals you already explained to them if they are listening and are trying to help you.
    2. If they identify things you haven't considered, you can learn from that.
- After they complete their visit to the property, ask them to generate an itemized proposal so you can see exactly what you are paying for. 
    - Many will refuse to do this. 
    - They want to be as generic as possible. You want them to be as specific as possible. 
    - If they won't do it, find out the reason. Sometimes they just don't have the time. If that's the case, ask them to provide a list of all the things they will do for the price they gave you. If they won't do that, it's a bad sign - they are either trying to hide something from you, or they don't know themselves, and neither are good. Even if they do amazing work and have a great record, they are not well-suited for working with investors.
- The itemized list is crucial for comparing one contractor's pricing to another and for assembling the list of work to be completed. Pick all the work that you want done from the different items identified that you think are important and send the "final" list back to all the contractors who impressed you, asking them to fill in the gaps from their proposal.
    - You can ask them to incluse materials or not. If you do, your life will be a bit easier, but you wont know if they are over-charging you. The author purchases the materials himself and has them delivered to the job site.

#### Researching the contractors

- After narrowing down the list, compare the quotes - throw any outliers out.
- At this point, the remaining bids will likely be very close. Consider that some things may be more important than the small difference in price. Do some background work on the contractors left and find out who has the best reputation.
- Wait until this stage of the process to investigate because it can be a very time-consuming process.
- Use yelp, google their name, and ask them for references from former clients.
    - If you hear a bad review from a referral, dig a little deeper - did the client have realistic expectations? Did they know what they were doing?
    - Find out how many times the contractor had to go back to fix mistakes, how proactive they were in solving problems, how well they stuck t the schedule, etc. These conversations can be lengthy.

#### Negotiating your bids
- All that's left is choosing the one you're most comfortable with.
- Don't negotiate the entire job - approach each line item individually.
- Ask them where there is flexibility in their bids and try to find ways of doing it cheaper. If one contractor allots four hours for the same job that another allotted one, you might have something to work with.
- When you have selected a contractor, the only remaining step is to work out the schedule.
- Ask them to be very conservative and to allow for plenty of setbacks. Once you get a number, ask them if there is any reason why they shouldn't be able to complete the job in this time frame. Once they say no, add to the contract (the itemized proposal) that if the job is completed before the time-frame identified, you will include a small bonus (2%-5%). Also include that for every week that the job goes over, 5% will be withheld.
    - Lots of contractors don't like this. This is exactly why they are given the opportunity to give a conservative estimate. It is important for them to understand that they are entering into a contract with you and that you expect them to uphold it, just as you will.
    - If this is a problem for them, it could be a bad sign. Set the tone that you are a professional and that this will be a professional relationship based on professional standards.
- Include your contractors in the materials selection process. They have lots of experience with this and may have a good understanding of whats popular and what works well.
- A typical process might look like:
    1. Get pictures of what you want the job to look like from google, pinterest, or from previous remodels.
    2. Get the contractor to tell you where the best bet for finding the materials would be and how much they might cost.
    3. Contact the locations suggested and get pricing for the materials. Negotiate.
    4. Get a lead-time and place the order.
    5. Arrange for all the materials to be delivered to the jobsite on the day that the contractor has arranged to begin. 

## Chapter 6: Understanding your market

_"Successful investing professionals are disciplined and consistent, and they think a great deal about what they so and how they do it."_ - Benjamin Graham

- Real estate investing requires oversight - in some markets prices go up and down, and in others, they stay stable. You'll want to understand your markets so you know when to buy, when to hold, and when to sell.
- Each market is driven by some factor that make people want to live there - it could be the weather, the job market, the environment, etc. You'll want understand this so you can buy in areas with high demand.
- For example, some areas of the country are driven by the energy sector, so when the energy sector is up, these markets will be influenced in that direction and vice versa.
- Understand the "procuring cause" of every market you are involved in.

### Tracking property values
- You should track the value of your properties. The most accurate  way to do so is with a comparative market analysis (CMA) by a realtor.

### What to do when prices are rising
- When property values rise (and your equity increases), you should consider refinancing your loans in order to make the LTV more attractive to banks and to allow you to move some (or all) of your capital. 
- Liquidate equity via refinancing and/or a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC).
- Sometimes prices rise so much that it doesn't make sense to leave that money where it is, and you should consider selling.
- Positioning yourself in markets before prices increase is one of the most effectives ways to increase your wealth via real estate, but you should avoid buying houses that don't cash flow based on speculation that the value will appreciate to make up for it.
- Converting appreciated equity to cash flow takes less time than acquiring enough savings through cash flow to buy more property. In other words, appreciation is a faster way to build wealth than cash flow.
- Learning how to anticipate changing market trends is a crucial part of successful investing. Learn how to identify properties that will both cash-flow from day one _and_ appreciate in value over time.

### What to do when prices are dropping
- When prices are dropping, you want to be in a position to buy more property - often this means liquidating.
- You need to understand both _what_ the market is doing and _why_ it is doing it so you can take advantage of the changes before others do.
- Property owners can still do well even in a bad economy as long as the expenses are covered by the tenants. One of the great things about real estate is that investors don't get hurt by falling prices until they sell. If a property cash flows, a drop in property value may not be a problem. But if you are in an area where people are leaving because the economy has turned, and they're not coming back, you may want to sell ASAP.
- Decreasing prices should be exciting for investors because down markets are where the majority of investors build the majority of their wealth.

### Investing in down markets, wherever they may be
- When home prices are falling, opportunities to buy cash-flowing properties increase exponentially.
- Investing out of state allows you to take advantage of rising prices and falling prices simultaneously.

### Rental rates
- The most accurate way to assess rental values is through a property manager.
- It's important to understand _why_ rental prices are what they are what they are so you can keep your finger on the pulse of the market.

### Anticipating rental rate increases 
- one of your goals as a buy-and-hold investor is to locate areas where you believe demand is going to increase. Entire books have be written on the subject, but the best way is to lean on the experts in those areas: property managers, real estate agents, other investors, etc.

### Following employment trends
- Employment trends are important in helping you know how long you can expect rental rates to maintain and/or increase/decrease. People move to where they can find work and they pay for as much house as their job will afford them. Hot markets follow jobs, not the other way around.
- Employments trends will also affect the demographic and financial status of your tenant.

### Understanding your tenant pool
- You want to give people what they want, so you need to understand what they want.

_"Simply put, the job market is the number one factor that will influence both the rate you can charge for rent and value of the house. Home demand, including pricing and rent values is a produce of the job market and accompanying wages. Learn to understand it and follow it closely."_

## Chapter 7: Working with the market

_"Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it"_ - Warren Buffett

- We have no control over the market as investors, so all we can do it try to take advantage of the waves.

### Creating an apples-to-apples comparison
- When comparing opportunities, be sure to use the same evaluation process for both 
- ROI is a valuable tool for evaluating the earning potential of a property, but it isn't the only thing to consider, especially once some equity has been developed.
- Return on Equity (ROE) can help you determine if it is worthwhile to keep your equity where it is or if you should move it elsewhere.

### Understanding Return on Equity (ROE)
- ROE = (annual cash flow)/(equity value)
- When your ROE is low, that means there is an opportunity the extract your equity and reinvest in additional properties, significantly improving your cash flow.
- ROE isn't talked about much because, historically, people bought and sold in the same market, so there was typically very little opportunity to move money from one area with high prices to another area with prices rising

### Timing the market
- It's important to understand why a market is changing in order to know whether it has reach a peak or valley, or if it is still moving.
- Some signs that prices are going to start falling:
    - Increase in the number of days that houses are on the market
    - Abnormal lending practices becoming more common
    - Employers leaving an area
    - Significant concessions offered to buyers

### The "headache factor" and opportunity cost
- Besides return on your money, it is also important to consider how much time you have to manage your business because sometimes properties that generate more income are also more difficult.
- With buy-and-hold investing, you generally want your properties to take up as little of your time as possible.

#### How to determine the headache factor of an area
- Get good information from the right people by building relationships.

### Improving your portfolio's performance
- Be careful not to overlook the big picture solely for the opportunity to increasing your ROI by a few percentage points. Sometimes the sweet spot isn't the one that makes the most money, but the one at the right intersection between profitability and vacancy/appreciation potential/cultural factors/the effect on your portfolio

### Timing your lease renewals correctly
- Consider structuring your leases to expire in the early or mid-summer because this is when there is more demand. This creates some additional advantages:
    1. Tenants are more likely to accept a raise in rent if there is less time to find a new place before the end of summer.
    2. If a tenant decides to leave, the house will be vacant during the busiest selling months.
    3. Rent prices are typically increasing leading into summer, so a yearlong lease will be more advantageous when prices are high
- Avoid allowing properties to become vacant during December or January when no one is looking for a house to buy.

### Cash for keys
- In spite of your efforts to prevent it, there will come a time when you need a tenant to vacate before the end of their lease. If they don't want to leave, your best bet may be to offer them cash to break the lease.

### Accept some headaches

_"You don't have to see the top of the staircase to take the first step."_ - Martin Luther King Jr.

- Sometimes properties that require more work are the only ones we can afford or can get financing for. Sometimes it just takes more work when you're getting started.
- Learning to manage tenants and properties in the worst situations can make you an expert if you can survive it.
- If you find yourself in a tough market, your goal should be to build equity and exit as soon as possible.
- Some areas are simply better suited for real estate investing due to more favorable laws for landlords.

### The 1031 Like-kind exchange
- The IRS allows for capital gains on the sale of a property to be deferred if a like property is purchased with the proceeds from the sale.
- There are lots of rules, so be sure to consult a CPA, but in general, there is a time-limit on identifying properties, and a time-limit on closing.
