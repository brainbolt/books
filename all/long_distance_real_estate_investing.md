## Chapter 1: Why Invest Out of State?
_"Ninety percent of millionaires become so through real estate. More money has been made in real estate than in all industrial investments combined. The wise young man or wage earner of today invests his money in real estate."_ - Andrew Carnegie 
- Andrew Carnegie was one of the first American rags-to-riches stories. He worked many different jobs and invested in many industries, making his ultimate fortune by selling Carnegie Steel Company for $480 million in 1901, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world at that time. He gave away tremendous amounts of money over the rest of his life. He was a dominate business person with an incredible amount of experience and knowledge. With all of his knowledge, he recommended people invest their money in real estate.
- "In any profession, the longer you seek to understand the process, not the just the results, the better you will be at understanding the patterns that emerge."
- We often expect ourselves to be perfect as soon as we start getting into real estate, but we should give ourselves enough time to develop or skills.
- Often people are trained to look for reasons _not to_ do something, especially out-of-state investing.
- Invest where it makes the most sense for you, not where it is convenient, close, or comfortable.
### Don't Trust Your Gut
- Most people believe that you have to see a house to buy it, but they're really letting their feelings control them. They _feel_ more comfortable when they can see it for themselves.
- Investors focus on numbers; consumers focus on feelings.
- Feelings are not a good measure of a business investment.
- Emotions should be tuned out and you should use facts to make decisions.
- You have to be willing to do things in a different way than the "norm".
### Disrupt the Norm
- In the past, the only way to invest out of state was to trust people in the area. Trust leads to opportunity for fraud, and there was lots of fraud. The internet has changed all of this, but not everyone has realized it.
- Zillow (and companies like them) have changed the market through access to information. Technology changes things and it can be used as an effective weapon against the competition. 
- Technology is an important part of this process.
### Investing in Your Own Backyard
- "Investing in your own backyard" is the same as "investing where you know."
- You must understand the market in which you are investing, it just doesn't have to be near you.
### The Crop Analogy
- Think of different real estate markets as different fields for growing crops. Some will be better suited for different plants, and some farmers are more experienced in certain types of crops, but while the wise farmers understands that different crops require different knowledge, he also knows that they follow similar patterns, and that they could learn how to grow them.
- Real estate investing is a get-rich-slow game. The real value comes years after purchase, when rents have risen, the value of the property has increased, and significant equity has been accrued.
- Invest where demand is growing, not just in what is geographically close.
- Understanding different areas, emerging markets, and price-to-rent ratios is critical to investing well.
- Wealth can be built faster through combining strategies such as flipping, buy-and-hold rentals, and anticipating/reacting to market changes.
- Be an investor who diligently studies what to grow, where to grow it, and how to hire the field hands to do so.
#### (end of The Crop Analogy)
- When you you invest in real estate, you build wealth in your sleep, or while you're building other wealth, or working out at the gym. 
_"Landlords grow rich in their sleep without working, risking, or economizing"_ - John Stuart Mill

## Chapter 2: The Power of The Internet
- The internet is a powerful tool for long-distance real estate investing.
- MLS systems are the largest and most convenient method for buying properties.
- Property taxes are one of the largest, but easiest to overlook expenses in investment real estate. 
    - Tax records are often available online via county's tax assessor's website, and are often readily available via apps like Zillow.
    - Look out for "hidden" tax expenses like bonds which must be paid for by homeowners.
- Homeowner's insurance is important to understand:
    - Quotes can be easily acquired either by requesting them directly from agents or by getting online quotes.
    - Consider keeping your costs down by getting the largest deductible possible.
    - Looks for insurance agency reviews for specific areas via google w/ searches like "best homeowner's insurance Atlanta", or "investor homeowner's insurance Atlanta". Look for review's of insurers on blogs.
- Determine an area's desirability:
    - The best information comes from people intimately familiar with the area, but apps like Zillow and Trulia can offer metrics to help you confirm what you are being told.
    - Pay attention to:
        - School rankings
        - Walk score (how easy it is to live in an area without a car)
            - Most important in densely-populated areas
            - [WalkScore.com](http://walkscore.com)
        - Crime stats
            - High crime creates lots of problems in real estate investing.
            - Use Trulia's crime Heat Maps
- Determining rental rates:
    - Property managers will typically be the most accurate souce of information, but they are often optimistic 
    - In general, trust experts and verify what they are telling you
    - [Rentometer.com](http://rentometer.com) is a useful tool for _quickly_ determining rental pricing
    - craigslist is also very useful for getting _detailed_ information
        - How long do rental listings remain active?
        - How long have the properties have been vacant? (ask the owners)
        - How much activity are the rentals getting? (ask the owners)
        - If you see listings disappearing quickly, it is a good sign that there is a lot of demand.
    - The best information comes from people
- Finding past permits:
    - The reality of investment real estate is that the houses are usually older homes which often need some work, but this enables us to buy below market value.
    - Understanding the history of the work done on the house is important.
    - Many counties keep permits as public record available via their website.
    - Don't trust your own non-expert opinion over getting the facts.
### The internet cheat sheet:
- **General pricing and availability**: zillow, trulia
- **Property taxes**: county websites and some online services
- **Homeowners insurance**: online quotes and agent emails
- **Neighborhood fact checking**: walkability (walkscore), crime rates (trulia), school district scores (zillow, trulia)
- **Rental pricing**: rentometer, zillow
#### (end)

- Smartphones can be used to move very quickly, and quickness is required in this highly-competitive field.
### Using technology to buy property sight unseen
- "Information makes people think; emotion makes them act."
- Photos and smartphone videos are a more-than-sufficient substitute for seeing a house in person.
- The big picture:
    - Video serves as proof of work done by a contractor (if they won't send photos, something fishy is going on) and as documentation of each step of the rehab process, which can be used as a sales tool.
    - Ask the person selling you the property to send you the following video:
        1. Start on the side walk in front of the property and walk the exterior.
        2. Walk the entire interior, audibly pointing out the features of the home you should take notice of, the areas you may miss, and the problem areas you will want to note for later.
        - This provides a ton of useful information that can be passed on to property managers, contractors, or anyone else.
### Battling the bugs
- If you encounter issues transferring phone videos, upload to youtube.
### Using your smartphone
- Many people aren't as busy as they think they are.
- Manage your time by breaking your communication into small, manageable chunks instead of trying to hash it all out at once.
- Many phone calls include a lot of time spent on etiquette and pleasantries which aren't really necessary. Text messages can be a useful alternative.
### Smartphone Apps
- Apps are good.
- Mortgage Calculator Plus
- JotNot Pro: convert paper files into pdfs by taking pictures
- DocuSign
- Skype: Some notaries will operate over video calls
- Numbers: spreadsheet
- Rev: voice note recordings 
- Keller Williams: home pricing
### The cloud
- It's good.

## Chapter 3: Rules and relationships
_"If you don't have a competitive advantage, don't compete"_ - Jack Welch
- Real estate investing is about finding deals, plain and simple.
- You make your money when you buy.
- The entire investing process should be viewed as trying to lose as little equity as possible.
- The most efficient investors are those who have learned to:
    1. Find properties below market value.
    2. Prepare them to be rented or sold by adding the most value for the least money.
- Your main goal should be to find value efficiently.
- Paying full price in a great area won't build wealth as fast as getting a great deal in a good area.
- Even if you know how to find great deals, it won't help if you don't know how to assemble a good team to help you.
- Focus on your areas of strength and lean on experts in your areas of weakness.
- You will want to quit if you make things too hard for yourself. Most people overestimate their willpower.

### Price-to-rent ratios
_"Buy not on optimism but on arithmetic"_ - Warren Buffet
- The buy-and-hold strategy requires a market where rents haven't been outpaced by home values. If they have, money can still be made by flipping houses.
    - **Buy-and-hold**: The house will rent for more than the expenses associated with the property.
    - **Flipping**: The house will sell for significantly more than the cost of purchase plus rehab.
- Many successful investors have portfolios in the South or Midwest, where PTR ratios are historically strong.
- Not many people have large portfolios in NY or CA because of the high prices

### Determine an areas PTR ratio
- Basically, subtract the costs from the recurring rental income. If you have money left over, you're making money. Otherwise, no.
- Rules of thumb (quick, fast, and dirty calculations)
    - When he sees a potential opportunity, David first runs the 1% calc to see if it meets his criteria for rentals. If not, he runs the 70% rule. If neither work, he passes.
    - Teach your agent to run these numbers for you before bringing you a property to consider.
    - **1% rule** (useful for rental investing): if a property can rent for 1% of its sale price each month, there is a good chance it will cash-flow well.
    - **70% rule** (useful for flipping): multiply the after-repair value (ARV) by 70% and then subtract your expected rehab expenses to come up with a conservative purchasing offer that will likely cover holding costs, quiet costs, unexpected expenses, permits, missions, and taxes.
    - **2% rule**: typically this metric means that the property is either a screaming deal, or that the neighborhood is a problem. Approach with extreme caution and only with the help of people with experience in this type of market.
    - **50% rule**: 50% of the rental income will go towards repairs and holding costs other than the mortgage. David considers this too general.

### Alternatives to buy-and-hold
- **Flipping**: faster with more profit compared to the slower profit realization of buy-and-hold.
    - Typically the main difference is in the types of materials used in the rehab (flipping usually involves more expensive, higher-quality materials)
- **Slow-flip**: buy the house, live in it for a year or two (while rehabilitating, if necessary), and then sell it. There can be tax advantages to this approach.

### Vacation rentals
- Potentially more income, but also potentially more work to rent and prepare, and more liability.

### How to leverage relationships
- There can be huge advantages in having contacts in or intimate knowledge of an area.
- Relationships drive success.
- Being taught by someone is 100 times easier than learning on your own.
- The most important person on your team is the one finding you deals.
- As David has grown as an investor, he has stopped looking for deals and has started looking for people who have them.
- When he started investing in Florida, David had a competitive advantage because he had a wholesaler who would bring him deals and a lender who would provider him with better financing than he could get anywhere else. Then he found the other missing pieces. He now believes this is the way to go - leverage relationships to build a foundation first. These relationships take time and effort and not all of them are home runs, but we all know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody else who might be helpful for us in reaching our goals.

_"The richest people in the world look for and build networks everyone else looks for work. Marinate on that for a minute"_ - Robert Kiyosaki

## Chapter 4: The first members of your team
_"Everyone enjoys the kind of work for which he is best suited"_ - Napoleon Hill
- Leveraging the talents of skilled professionals is very important in this business, and one of your goals is to identify the right people and to help them succeed.
- Automating by outsourcing frees up more of your time to do what really matters to you
- Real estate investing is a business and needs to be run like one. Use trial and error, consistency, and wisdom to find the people who are really, really good at what they do so you can save time, money, and anxiety.
### Key people to look for
#### The deal finder
- **The most important part of your business.**
- Traditionally a real estate agent (REA), but sometimes wholesalers.
- Good REA's are worth their weight in gold because they are surrounded by people who are likely to find the properties investors want and they are trained in finding properties and handling the transactions.
- Use a REA over a wholesaler in the beginning, especially when buying out of state unless you are an experienced investor with a good accountant, good counsel, and a knack for paperwork.
- The seller pays the agent, not the buyer. Even if you can theoretically get a better deal by not using an agent, this usually doesn't work out in practice because people willing to sell under market value are usually motivated by circumstances rather than purely by money - they are often trying to solve a problem.
- The drawbacks of using an agent are small, and the benefits are large.

#### High-producing agents
- Online reviews can be a great way to find an agent.
- While number of sales is not the most important factor, it can be a good indicator that the agent works well with others and that they are less likely to waste your time and are more likely to have additional resources you will need later.
- <http://zillow.com/agent-finder> can be a great way to find high-producing agents.

#### Agents with a team
- Often run a team because they have had so much success that they needed help.
- Can often cherry-pick the best/brightest agents to work for them.
- They are often personally too busy to working with a needy investor, so they will usually refer you to their "buyer's agent" to be your point of contact. This person is very likely to be a good agent since they work for the high-producer and have access to the high-producer's resources.

#### Ways to save time on your search
- Use email to introduce yourself to REA's instead of trying to call all of them - you are more likely to get through to them and you can include more information that will help the agent know if they are a good fit for your needs.
    - Things to include in an email introduction:
        1. That you are an investor
        2. What specifically you are looking for
        3. How you intend to purchase (cash, loan, etc.)
        4. How you heard about them
        - Make it specific enough that they can see that you are serious and that your aren't going to waste their time.
- Ask the right questions to find the right agent
    - **Do they have experience working with investors?** This is not required, but it is very helpful.
    - **Are they an investor themselves?** It is extremely helpful if the agent has been through the ups and downs of investing themselves.
        - If so, ask them what kind of returns they are experiencing, how they found the properties, what kind of analysis they used, and what drew them to investing in the first place. If they seem to be nonchalant about it, this may indicate that they are not systematically planning for growing a portfolio. If they are specific and meticulous and moved quickly when the right deal was found, they may be much better suited to help you find what you are looking for.
    - **What kind of support can they provide?** You want to know who your agent knows. Getting referrals is much more valuable than searching cold.
    - **How do they plan to find your potential properties?** If they don't have a clear plan, you may be in trouble.
    - Be sure to make it clear what kinds of properties you are wanting to see so you're not wasting your time looking through a bunch of results that will never work. The more specific, the better.
