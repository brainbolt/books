Nonviloent Communication: Create Your Life, Your Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values
Marshall Rosenberg  
ISBN none (audio training workshop)

## Session 1
- Maybe violence isn't the result of mental illness, but instead the result of the way people learn to see the world.
- What would it look like if people were to stay connected to their "compassionate nature", no matter what kind of social structures existed around them?

### Purpose of Nonviolent Communication
- "Help us connect with ourselves and others in a way that makes compassionate giving natural."
- Without the purpose in mind, the mechanics can become sterile.
- Compassionate giving: Doing something for ourselves or others where our sole intention is to enrich life.

### What is Nonviolent Communication?
1. Language
2. Strategies

#### The Process
- Focuses on two questions:
    - What's alive in you?
    - What would make life more wonderful?

- If we can focus on what is alive in us instead of focusing on the enemy images that we create when someone is doing something that we don't like, conflict can be resolved peacefully in ways that gets everyone's needs met.

- Communicating what is alive in us:
    - It's important to clearly separate what people are doing from evaluation that implies wrongness (or rightness, I would argue): "observation without evaluation"
    - Speak from the heart (speak to what is going on inside of us in relation to what is going on outside of us): feelings and needs
        - Needs: life in action
        - Feelings: connected to our needs
    - Communicate what would make life more wonderful

- We can also use the same process to receive what is alive in others, regardless of how articulate they are communicating it

### Destructive forms of communication
- Moralistic judgements
    - NVC judges from the standpoint of whether behavior supports life, not whether or not a person deserves to be rewarded or punished.
    - Thinking in terms of whats wrong with ourselves or others.
    - All such evaluations are tragic expressions of our own unmet needs.
        - Tragic because expressing in this way is often responded to with defensiveness. If someone does agree with our analysis of them, they will likely respond with fear, guilt, or shame. We pay dearly when people respond to our desires out of fear, guilt, or shame because it degrades our relationships and reduces the likelihood that they will respond compassionately in the future.
- Making comparisons
- Denial of responsibility
    - The language we choose influences how we think. People who say "I _have_ to" may come to believe that they have no other choice. The person who says "you _make me feel_ sad" may believe that their sadness is the fault of the other person.
- Communicating desires as commands
    - Communication that contains implicit or explicit threat of blame/punishment is they refuse to comply
- Reward/punishment
    - Connected with the concept of "deserve" (as in he _deserves_ punishment for what he did)
    - Two questions that, if we were to ask ourselves, would motivate us away from desiring to use punishment/reward as a motivator:
        1. What would we like this person to do differently?
            - Punishment/reward seem like a viable option if your stop after asking this question.
        2. What do I want their reasons for doing what we ask to be?

#### The Process continued
- The intention is to create a connection that allows everyone to get their needs met, not to get what you want.
- Make a clear observation without mixing in evaluations. This is often very difficult to do, but is very important.
- Expressing feelings without mixing in thoughts.
- Expressing needs
